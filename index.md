  # Secret Rhythm Project
---

Secret Rhythm Project has been playing together in some form for more than 20 years. The current line-up has been together since 2017 and plays regularly in the Worcester, MA and Boston areas. The band deftly mixes improvisational funk-rock with neatly packaged songs, filling a space somewhere between Black Sabbath and Parliament-Funkadelic.
